# Blackjack Game - JavaScript (Vite)

## Description

This project is a **Blackjack** game developed with **JavaScript** and bundled using **Vite**. The goal of the game is to reach a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, competing against the dealer (the computer).

You can play it live here: [Blackjack Game](https://obed-dev.github.io/js-blackjack-vite-main/)

## Game Rules

1. Each player starts with two cards.
2. The goal is to have a hand with a value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
3. Cards from 2 to 10 are worth their number. J, Q, and K cards are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever benefits the player.
4. Players can choose to draw more cards ("Hit") or stick with their current hand ("Stand").
5. The dealer also draws cards but follows a specific rule: they must draw a card if their score is 16 or less and stop if their score is 17 or higher.
6. You win if your score is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over 21.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Game structure.
